        <h1>History of Yala National park</h1><br>
        <div class="container-item">
            <p>Yala National Park, situated in the southeastern corner of Sri Lanka, boasts a rich and storied history
                that spans centuries. Initially designated as a protected area in 1900, it was later declared a wildlife
                sanctuary in 1938, making it the country's oldest national park. The park's origins are deeply
                intertwined with the narrative of wildlife conservation in Sri Lanka, reflecting the nation's commitment
                to preserving its natural heritage. Yala's evolution continued with expansions and modifications to its
                boundaries over the years, with the goal of encompassing diverse ecosystems and ensuring the survival of
                indigenous flora and fauna.</p><br>

            <p>During the colonial era, Yala served as a hunting ground for the elite, showcasing the diverse range of
                wildlife that drew the interest of British rulers. However, the park's true transformation began in the
                post-independence period when concerted efforts were made to protect and conserve its unique
                biodiversity. Today, Yala is renowned for its incredible biodiversity, with a particular emphasis on the
                leopard population. The park's complex landscape includes grassy plains, dense forests, and coastal
                areas, providing a habitat for not only leopards but also elephants, sloth bears, crocodiles, and
                numerous bird species.</p><br>

            <p>Yala National Park has become a symbol of successful wildlife conservation in Sri Lanka, attracting
                nature enthusiasts and researchers from around the globe. The park's history reflects the ongoing
                commitment of the Sri Lankan government and conservationists to safeguard the nation's natural treasures
                and ensure a sustainable coexistence between humans and wildlife in this ecological haven.</p><br>

                <p>Yala National Park, situated in the southeastern part of Sri Lanka, is renowned for its tropical
                    climate, characterized by high temperatures that contribute to its distinctive ecosystem. The park
                    experiences a predominantly dry and arid climate, with temperatures soaring during the daytime. In
                    the peak of the dry season, which typically spans from May to August, Yala encounters scorching
                    temperatures that can surpass 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><br>
                    
                <p>The combination of intense sunlight and minimal rainfall during this period results in a landscape
                    that appears parched and rugged, adorned with shrubbery adapted to withstand the relentless heat.
                    The scarcity of water sources intensifies the heat, drawing animals to the few remaining watering
                    holes in a captivating display of survival instincts.</p>
