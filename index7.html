        <h1>History of wilpattu National park</h1><br>
        <div class="container-item">
            <p>Wilpattu National Park, located in the northwest of Sri Lanka, boasts a storied history that spans
                centuries. The name "Wilpattu" itself is derived from the combination of the Sinhalese words "Wilu"
                (meaning lakes) and "Pattu" (meaning ten), aptly reflecting the numerous natural lakes scattered
                throughout the park's landscape. Historically, this expansive sanctuary served as a royal hunting ground
                for Sri Lankan kings, showcasing the deep-rooted connection between humans and nature.</p><br>

            <p>During the colonial era, Wilpattu faced challenges, as some areas were transformed for agricultural
                purposes. However, efforts were made to preserve the park, leading to its declaration as a sanctuary in
                1905 and later as a national park in 1938. Unfortunately, the park faced a period of neglect and
                destruction during the civil unrest in Sri Lanka, which significantly impacted its flora and fauna. In
                recent times, Wilpattu has undergone significant restoration and conservation efforts, reclaiming its
                status as one of Sri Lanka's premier wildlife sanctuaries. Today, it stands as the largest national park
                in the country, covering an impressive expanse of over 1,300 square kilometers. </p><br>

            <p>The park's diverse ecosystems, ranging from dense woodlands and scrublands to coastal areas, provide a
                haven for a wide array of wildlife, including elephants, leopards, sloth bears, and numerous bird
                species. Wilpattu National Park not only represents a triumph of conservation but also serves as a
                testament to the resilience of nature in the face of historical challenges. As visitors explore its
                landscapes, they are not only treated to the beauty of Sri Lanka's wildlife but also immersed in the
                historical tapestry that has shaped this remarkable national park.</p><br>

                <p>Wilpattu National Park, situated in the northwest of Sri Lanka, experiences a tropical climate
                    characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons. The weather at Wilpattu varies throughout the year,
                    creating a dynamic environment for its diverse wildlife and lush landscapes. The dry season
                    typically spans from May to September, during which the park receives minimal rainfall, and
                    temperatures rise. This period offers favorable conditions for wildlife sightings as animals
                    congregate around available water sources.</p><br>

                <p>In contrast, the wet season, from October to January, sees increased rainfall, rejuvenating the
                    park's vegetation and creating vibrant landscapes. The cooler months from December to February
                    provide a pleasant climate for visitors.During the wet season, Wilpattu transforms into a lush,
                    green paradise, with water-filled lakes and ponds attracting a multitude of bird species. The park's
                    diverse ecosystems, including dense scrub jungles, open grassy plains, and shimmering lakes,
                    contribute to its unique weather patterns.</p><br>
