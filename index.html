                <p>Like many islands, Sri Lanka boasts a high number of endemic species, animals and plants found
                    nowhere else on Earth. The country is also regarded as one of the world's top five hotspots for
                    biodiversity, testament to the sheer number of species which call the tear drop isle home. Read on
                    to learn what you can discover in some of Sri Lanka's best national parks.And its an island
                    nation situated in the Indian Ocean, is renowned for its diverse and unique wildlife. The country's
                    rich biodiversity is influenced by its varied ecosystems, which include tropical rainforests, dry
                    plains, coastal areas, and highland regions</p><br>

                <p>The beautiful island of Sri Lanka is an absolute delight with so many different attractions to see.
                    From cultural and historical sites to golden sandy beaches and amazing wildlife, there is so much to
                    love about this picturesque island nation. Although it is the diversity of experiences that makes
                    Sri Lanka one of the best holiday destinations in the world, its wildlife alone is a good enough
                    reason to visit Sri Lanka. A significant portion of the wildlife in Sri Lanka
                    is endemic to the country, while some, such as western reef egrets and Pacific Golden-Plover,
                    migrate to the warmer climates of the country when it starts getting colder in their own home
                    countries. Like everyone else, these birds seem to love the warm temperatures in Sri Lanka that are
                    prevalent all year round.</p>
