        <h1>About the Srilankan leopard</h1><br>
        <div class="container-item">
            <p>The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) stands as an emblem of Sri Lanka's rich biodiversity and
                serves as a flagship species for wildlife conservation in the region. Endemic to the island, this
                subspecies of the leopard is revered for its unique characteristics and adaptability to various
                habitats, ranging from dense tropical rainforests to arid plains. The Sri Lankan leopard is
                distinguished by its robust build, shorter legs, and a striking golden-yellow coat adorned with distinct
                dark rosettes. Facing the dual challenges of habitat loss and increasing human-wildlife conflicts, the
                Sri Lankan
                leopard has garnered attention from conservationists and researchers alike. Its elusive nature adds an
                air of mystery, making it a sought-after subject for wildlife enthusiasts visiting national parks like
                Yala and Wilpattu.Efforts to conserve the Sri Lankan leopard involve a blend of habitat protection,
                community engagement,
                and research initiatives. As a symbol of the island's natural heritage, the conservation of this unique
                subspecies represents a crucial step toward preserving the ecological balance and cultural identity of
                Sri Lanka.</p><br>

                <h2>Poaching</h2><br>
                <p>Leopard poaching, driven by illegal wildlife trade and habitat loss, poses a severe threat to the
                    survival of these majestic big cats. The demand for leopard body parts, skins, and bones in
                    traditional medicine and the exotic pet trade drives the illicit activities, causing detrimental
                    consequences for both leopards and ecosystems.</p><br>
